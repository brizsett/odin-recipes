# odin-recipes
This is my first independent HTML project: a recipe book, although with only 4 recipes.
The page is very basic on purpose since it serves as practice and not something to be used by others.
Since I already have a large collection of recipes in Hungarian, halfway through I switched to those to save me time in searching for recipes.
